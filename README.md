# YOLOv8 Object Detection with Streamlit

This is a simple object detection web app built with YOLOv8 and Streamlit. The app uses a pretrained YOLOv8 model to detect objects in uploaded images and displays the bounding boxes along with the prediction results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit for building the web app
- YOLOv8 model for object detection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project folder.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
